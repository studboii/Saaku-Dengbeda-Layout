I"´	<p>â€œTake it or leave itâ€, the scrawny looking man told me. I stood there contemplating whether I was that desperate or not. Conflicting thoughts poured down into my seemingly large head in a heated battle of wits with each other claiming how one is far more superior to the otherâ€¦ Or so it seemed to me.
Did I need it? Was I that unsettled and sleepless over something as pointless as that. Maybe I was or maybe I was just very lonely.
The weird high I got on its consumptionâ€¦The sense of satisfaction and calmâ€¦ The way all signs of hunger for it disappeared just by its intoxicating aroma. Of course, the man trying to sell it to me was oblivious to this heated debate in my head.
â€œI canâ€™t lower the price any furtherâ€¦ thatâ€™s the lowest I can afford to go and this is the last one mind youâ€¦ Itâ€™s become very rare with the government ban getting serious and stuffâ€¦..â€
<br /><br />
BANâ€¦ The shortest word in the world that makes people rebel against something by just being there. Itâ€™s funny how the human mind worksâ€¦We donâ€™t give a damn about something until we are told itâ€™s off-limits and forbidden. It made me thinkâ€¦ Would Adam and Eve eat that apple if God didnâ€™t tell them anything about not eating it?? There were more interesting things thereâ€¦Whoâ€™d give that much thought about eating a tiny apple hanging from a treeâ€¦
I canâ€™t help but wonder if this is just me trying to rebel against something I am clearly asked not to doâ€¦Or was it simply Desperation arising out of intense addiction and unexplained hunger. The latter made me feel bad about my self-control abilitiesâ€¦ Could it be true?? Was I addicted??
â€œPlease Hurry up Sir!!â€ The man said kicking me out of my deep, made up, philosophical, extremely intellectually, thought-provoking, universe.
I looked at him and saw the desperation of a different kind one thatâ€™s fuelled by the desire of getting rid of something that would affect oneâ€™s societal trust rankings and undermine any future venture one would attempt to venture for the time the memory of this exchange existed in peopleâ€™s mind. If it ever got out that isâ€¦<br />
I look at him and say what heâ€™s waiting for me to say for so long,<br />
<br />â€œIâ€™ll Take Itâ€<br />
â€œGood to know!!â€<br />
He says sarcastically but relieved as he sells it to me.
I walk home with a weird sense of accomplishment of being the owner of the last packet there was. The last available packet of Maggi.</p>
